                <h1 class="header-desing">Problem 1: Where Do I Start?</h1>
                <p>When I first started learning programming, I felt lost. There were too many languages and tools, and I didn’t know what to choose first.</p>
                <p class="solution">✅ Start simple: Begin with HTML and CSS to understand how websites are built. Then move to JavaScript. Don’t rush — just take one step at a time.</p>

                <h1 class="header-desing">Problem 2: How Do I Understand a Programming Language?</h1>
                <p>Even after choosing a language, it was hard to really understand it. I could read the code, but I didn’t always know why things worked or what each part did.</p>
                <p class="solution">✅ What helped me: I practiced by typing the code myself and building small projects. I asked “why” instead of just copying. Watching videos and breaking code into parts made things easier to understand.</p>

                <h1 class="header-desing">Problem 3: Struggling with Patience and Time Management</h1>
                <p>Sometimes I got frustrated because I wasn’t learning fast. I wanted to understand everything quickly, but I often felt stuck or confused. I also didn’t know how to manage my study time.</p>
                <p class="solution">✅ What helped me: I gave myself time. I made a simple study schedule — just 1 hour a day. I celebrated small wins and reminded myself that learning is a journey, not a race.</p>

                <h1 class="header-desing">Problem 4: Learning Alone Can Feel Lonely</h1>
                <p>Learning to code by myself felt hard. There was no teacher or classmate beside me, and I often felt like giving up when I got stuck.</p>
                <p class="solution">✅ What helped me: I joined an institute called Up Skills Hub, where I found other beginners like me. Being part of a real learning environment gave me motivation, support, and guidance. I didn’t feel alone anymore — I had people to ask questions and learn with.</p>

                <h1 class="header-desing">Problem 5: I Didn’t Know What to Build</h1>
                <p>Even after learning some code, I didn’t know how to use it creatively. I kept asking myself, “What should I build?” and I got stuck.</p>
                <p class="solution">✅ What helped me: I started with simple ideas — a personal website, a to-do list, or a calculator. I took inspiration from websites like Frontend Mentor or GitHub. With practice, I started getting more creative.</p>

                <h1 class="header-desing">Problem 6: How to Treat Myself When I Feel Tired or Stuck</h1>
                <p>Sometimes I felt burned out, especially when I couldn’t fix a bug or finish a task. I blamed myself and felt like quitting.</p>
                <p class="solution">✅ What helped me: I learned to take breaks and not be too hard on myself. I reminded myself that frustration is part of learning. A short rest, a walk, or even a funny video helped me come back with fresh energy</p>
